The dataset contains information from various high schools, showing us reading and math scores, school size, type of school, and school budget. 
We used the data from several district and charter schools to find if there were any correlation between school size, budget, type of school, and scores. 

We made and merged data frames to  help us easily read the data and be able to draw conclusions about the different school. 

From the data, we can draw the conclusion that higher budget per student doesn't mean that students performed better in school. 

I used Xpert Learning Assistant to get some of my code for the challenge, as well as help from a tutor.
